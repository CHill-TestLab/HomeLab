# HomeLab

I'm tinkering with my HomeLab mainly to continue developing my Networking & Backend skills.
Plus I think it's cool to have your own HomeLab
<br></br>
`Hardware: Beelink MINI S12 w/ Proxmox Hypervisor`

<div>Yeah... it's a pretty random device to run a home lab from.</div>
It's only got 16GB of RAM, so it's definitely a minimalistic setup - but I'd rather have something than nothing.
I've put the Proxmox Hypervisor on there and just split out the resources to have the distributions listed below run.
Probably one of the most useful concepts I learned in my IT course, in addition to everything else network related.
<br></br>

`RockyLinux9: DNS`

Not much to say on this one apart from using BIND for DNS resolution.
<br></br>

`Alpine: WebServer`

<div>I skipped the OOBE setup for Alpine, so I basically did all the configuration manually by accident. I was very confused as to why everything I read claimed Alpine was easy to setup.</div>
<div>I'm not much of a WebDev. I feel I'd get caught up in the design, when I really want to focus on function.</div>
<div>So for practicalities sake, I made my homepage and directory as simple as possible and moved on.</div>
<br></br>

`FreeBSD: Git & Development Server`

<div>I've only recently set this up properly with SSH access to GitHub, but time will tell how effective this is as a development environment.</div>
<br></br>

`ArchLinux: Networking + Experimental Lab`

Bit of a cliche to have Arch, but learning how to allocate memory blocks, mount disks, and work from the ground up kept me engaged for hours.
Will likely rip this down and try again without any assistance, I did need a bit of a crutch with the mounting section.
Definitely using this as a learning experience.
